<p>The worst I ever procrastinated was in the summer of 2021 when I did my "independent research" as a part of the McNair Scholars program. 
  The "Summer Research Institute" was designed for first generation STEM students, but I was in a not-particularly-rigorous film program with no research focus.
  No one ever told me how to "do research" in the humanities. 
  In fact, I didn't really understand what "research" was, but I had three months to do "original research" and present my "findings" at a confererence.
  I was provided a dorm on campus for the summer, a generous stipend, and an allowance for groceries. By this time, I had never lived away from home. 

  
<p>In May (or was it June?) of that year, I had been visiting with my best friend Li in New Mexico, outside Santa Fe. 
  Li is the only person in my life who pushes me to both work harder and relax more. 
  I got more done in two weeks with Li than in two years of college. 
  We mapped out a five year plan for our graphic novel, and participated in an online fanart/fanfiction exchange. 
  I read <i>Ametora</i> and <i>Babel-17</i>. Li was getting into Irigiray. 
  At the time, I had become newly interested in computer science and was trying to find a "way in" via literature. 
  At the same time, I was also in the process of submitting a weeks-late paper for my Multicultural Literature class.
  
  
  <p>I submitted my research proposal from Li's house on a shared ranch property, and the rest of my proposal from a film festival on a beach in Southern California.
  I reached out to the only professor at my film school with a PhD. (He had published a paper on Mexican wrestling shows 20 years ago). 
  Despite being the kind of person to never check his email (never ever), he eventually agreed to "advise" me. 
  I had no idea what this was supposed to entail, but it was a mandatory condition of the program.

<p>The research I proposed to do would be about streaming services and the Covid-19 pandemic. 
  Back in Cleveland, as I prepared to start my research, my parents (with much pomp and circumstance) moved me into the dorms on campus (20 minutes from our house).
  That summer I printed out hundreds, if not thousands, of academic articles on topics related to streaming--some only tenuously--and prepared to craft my argument. 
  I checked out several books about Netflix, etc., which I really enjoyed, but I went fully stir crazy in my little dorm room as I tried to "do research." 
  I had a hard time figuring out what research was supposed to look like. I found myself googling stupid things like "what is research?" and "what does n equal?" 
  I felt too clueless to ask my advisor what I was supposed to be doing, so I read the books, I read the articles, I drank Monster energy drinks, I tried to learn Python.
  I went to the Zoom conferences and the mandatory cultural events, but by the end of the summer I was not really sure if I had "done research."
  
<p>I knew that I had wasted time. I had kicked my feet and installed a video game emulator on my laptop. 
  I had read more than I'd ever read until I had viewership data streaming out of my ears. 
  I made a spreadsheet, scrapped it, made another one. I made graphs that probably didn't say anything. 
 I booked an HRT appointment.
  I made a twitter account to look at fanart and ended up a part of a niche online community, which turned into a discord server, which turned into writing and drawing and role-playing with my favorite writers and artists and tweeteers, sometimes all night and into the morning.
  I listened to Hatsune Miku and kinnie playlists and Bo Burnham's Netflix special <i>Inside</i> on a constant loop until my brain melted like jello.

<p>I did not turn in my research paper that summer. Maybe I turned it in in October. I showed it to my advisor in December. 
  We both felt a little embarrassed at our lack of communication over the summer. 
  
  <p>"I'm sorry," we both said.</p>
  <p>"This is probably a really good social science paper," he continued. "You have all the citations. It's not the kind of thing I do. It's not film theory."
    
   <p>I wondered what the paper I'd wanted to write, but didn't know how, would have looked like. I wondered if he would have liked it.
